Thomas van den Heuvel is a postdoc in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl) and the [Medical Ultrasound Imaging Centre](http://music.radboudimaging.nl/index.php/Home). His research focuses on combining point-of-care ultrasound devices with deep learning solutions to facilitate diagnosis in resource-limited countries. During his PhD, he developed a deep learning software that automatically detects twin pregnancies, estimates gestational age and determines fetal presentation. The system is so easy to operate that any health care worker can use the device after two hours of training. Currently, the methods are implemented in Android based smartphones to further facilitate widespread use of this technology. He is supervised by Bram van Ginneken and Chris de Korte.
